			<p>Well, here it is, Touhou 18 has been announced on ZUN's new website and on his Twitter!
			The game is called Unconnected Marketeers (which creates the somewhat awkward acronym of "UM") and the demo will be released on March 21, with the full game apparently coming as early as May.
			The playable characters in this game will be Reimu, Marisa, Sakuya, and Sanae (the first time Sakuya and Sanae have been playable in the same game!)
			The gimmick of this game involves cards and purchasing upgrades, but we don't have much information on this at the moment.
			ZUN describes this mechanic as "a relatively challenging system for an STG" but "content that you can play without discomfort."
			At the moment, I'd expect the card mechanic to work similarly to the items in Impossible Spell Card.</p>
			<p align="center">With this announcement, we also got 6 screenshots.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="https://touhou-project.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/th18_01.jpg"></p>
			<p align="center">The first image is of the title screen.
			It's mostly just a standard Touhou title screen, not unlike what we've seen from the other games.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="https://touhou-project.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/th18_02.jpg"></p>
			<p align="center">The second image is of Reimu in the character select screen.
			Once again, it's very similar to previous Touhou games.
			The most notable feature is the cards, one featuring the magic mallet and one featuring Cirno.
			It's also unknown if this game will have A and B shots, but it seems unlikely.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="https://touhou-project.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/th18_03.jpg"></p>
			<p align="center">The third image shows the gameplay.
			There's a lot to talk about with this one.
			Reimu still has those needles when focused, so I'd expect her to be similar to her shot in Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom.
			The UI has lives and bombs as usual, marked with 0/3 which implies this game will also have life and bomb pieces.
			Below that is power, still on the 4.00 power scale, and something with a yellow item.
			According to Tanzureir, the text "資金力" translates to "money/fund power".
			Given that translation and the game's mechanic, it is most likely some form of currency.
			Below that is something that seems to keep track of which cards are equipped.
			Two notable omissions from this game's UI are a graze counter and point item value, so these mechanics may have been removed from this game.
			I wonder how scoring will work...
			Also, the enemies only drop power and yellow items, so it seems point items have been removed as well.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="https://touhou-project.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/th18_04.jpg"></p>
			<p align="center">The fourth image shows Sakuya's shot type.
			In this image, her main shot is shooting straight and her options are tilted and shooting to the right.
			This seems to be similar to how Sakuya B works in Perfect Cherry Blossom.
			The enemies in this image are also dropping power and yellow items but no point items.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="https://touhou-project.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/th18_05.jpg"></p>
			<p align="center">The fifth image simply shows Sakuya during dialogue.
			I'd also like to mention how much ZUN's art has improved, these portraits look much better than they did in the previous games.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="https://touhou-project.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/th18_06.jpg"></p>
			<p align="center">The final image shows Sanae during dialogue.</p>
			<p>Currently, Marisa's portrait hasn't been shown, and Marisa and Sanae's gameplay hasn't been shown at all.
			Given how recent Touhou games have been, I expect them to work as they do in LoLK.
			Now to wait for the demo and see how the game actually plays!</p>
